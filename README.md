 # HTML REGISTERATION PAGE
This is the first HTML page of registeration. In this project i covered the basics as well how to get started with your first project without having prior knowledge about the coding world.
HTML is a basic programming lanuguage and you can learn in less than an hour. Although HTML in today's world is outdated yet its a good way to start your full stack career.
Providing your customer with registeration page is with simple sign-up.
Inorder to learn HTML the first thing you need to do is to pick a HTML code editor, there are various html code editors. My personal favourite is VSCODE. It gives you loads of extension files which will help you in various ways such as live server, which help you to write code while making the changes  simultaneous.
